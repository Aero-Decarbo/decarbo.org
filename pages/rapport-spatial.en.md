If the effects of aeronautics on the climate are easily evaluated and known, this exercise is more difficult in the space sector. At Aero Decarbo, we are convinced that the energy and social transition concerns all sectors.

It is on this theme that the Space Decarbo group is actively working: environmental impact assessment, scientific and technological watch, evaluation of the positive impacts of space instruments, etc.

While the debate on air transport needs to be dispassionate, the space debate needs to exist.

Report on the subject to come!
