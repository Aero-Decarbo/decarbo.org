Few sectors occupy such a singular place in the energy transition landscape as aviation. As a cutting-edge industry with negligible climate impact for its defenders, and a fad of the ultra-rich who are used to minimizing their emissions for its detractors, it generates divisive opinions and sometimes sterile opposition.

The authors of this report support the idea that beyond these extreme positions, another voice must be heard.

We who love aviation and who, for many, have made it their profession, we who love technology, the great discoveries, all this prodigious human intelligence mobilized to make machines fly, we affirm that we love life, nature and science even more - this science which also rigorously describes aerodynamic and climate phenomena, this science whose benefits we cannot enjoy while ignoring the upheavals that it announces.

We, aeronautical engineers, pilots, air traffic controllers, airline employees, users or simple lovers of aviation, tired of the divisive discourses towards it, sign this report with the ambition of creating the conditions for a peaceful debate on its capacity to drastically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, in proportions compatible with a world that is liveable in 2100. We, climate-conscious aerophiles, claim to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem, by providing a transparent, disinterested and scientifically supported voice on what the aviation sector can do - but also cannot do - to decarbonize.
